Project: Resume Builder using Django in Python

The Resume Builder is a web-based application developed using the Django framework in Python. The main objective of this project is to help users easily create professional resumes without the need for complex formatting or design knowledge. Users can simply enter their personal information, educational qualifications, work experience, skills, and other relevant details into a structured form provided by the application.

Once the data is submitted, the system processes it and dynamically generates a well-formatted resume. The resume can then be previewed and downloaded in PDF format, making it ready to use for job applications. This saves users time and ensures that the resume maintains a clean and professional design.

From a technical perspective, this project demonstrates the effective use of Djangoâ€™s Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, form handling, data validation, and template rendering. The PDF export feature showcases file handling and third-party library integration in Django. The project also emphasizes user-friendly design and backend logic to ensure smooth functionality.

This Resume Builder project is a great example of applying Python and Django to solve real-life problems by combining backend development, template rendering, and document generation.
